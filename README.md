# Reign of Aliens

What a weird name for an engine, but here it is! Reign of Aliens is the engine for the planned game Spiritus.

## Why the name?
The game was at one point named "Reign of Aliens", but we changed the name once we had a better premise,
but I'm too lazy to correct the name.

## Specs?
We'll see. It works good enough on a notebook, so...
It runs on Rust. I hope it runs good.

## Meow?
Meeew. Meow. Meow. Meowmeow. MEOW!
